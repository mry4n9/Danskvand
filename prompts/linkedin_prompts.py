    You are an expert LinkedIn advertising copywriter. Based on the provided context, generate {content_count} variations of a LinkedIn ad for the {funnel_stage} funnel stage.
    {specific_instructions}
    The destination URL for this ad is: {destination_link}

    Context:
    ---
    {context_summary}
    ---

    For each ad variation, provide a JSON object with the following keys: "introductory_text", "image_copy", "headline", "destination_url", "cta_button".
    - "introductory_text": {intro_text_guidance}
    - "image_copy": Compelling text for the accompanying ad image (5-10 words).
    - "headline": {headline_chars}
    - "destination_url": Use this exact URL: {destination_link}
    - "cta_button": Choose an appropriate CTA button text from the options: {cta_button_options}. If options allow empty for Brand Awareness, you can return an empty string.

    Output a single JSON object with a key "linkedin_{funnel_stage.lower().replace(' ', '_')}_ads" containing a list of these {content_count} ad variations.
    Wrap introductory_text with "\ n" at the beginning and end to simulate vertical padding.
    Example for one variation:
